## Game Overview

- **4-12 Players**: Ghosts is designed for groups of 4 to 12 players who can communicate either in-person or over a video call.
- **Mystery and Deception**: Each player receives a secret word: the topic, a subtopic, or the word "ghost". Join the nail-biting race as Humans (topic and subtopic word holders) battle against the cunning Ghosts, trying to protect the topic while staying undercover.
- **Trust No One**: No one knows who's on their team or what words other players have. Ghosts must guess the topic or blend in to outnumber the Humans. Humans must do whatever it takes to protect the topic from Ghosts.
- **Engaging Gameplay**: Players take turns giving cryptic clues that relate to their secret words, trying not to reveal too much information to the Ghosts. Once everyone has given their clue, players vote anonymously to eliminate a player from the game.
- **Epic Showdown**: The game continues until Ghosts outnumber the Humans, guess the topic, or all Ghosts are eliminated. Will you outsmart your friends and lead your team to victory?
